# JSONAPI::Authorization

This gem is no longer maintained.

To view the old readme, head to [README-old.md](./README-old.md).

After a series of attempts, we never got `jsonapi-authorization` to be compatible with `jsonapi-resources`: https://github.com/venuu/jsonapi-authorization/issues/64

It is time to say goodbye. It was a good ride.
