# JSONAPI::Authorization

[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/venuu/jsonapi-authorization/master.svg?style=flat&maxAge=3600)](https://travis-ci.org/venuu/jsonapi-authorization) [![Gem Version](https://img.shields.io/gem/v/jsonapi-authorization.svg?style=flat&maxAge=3600)](https://rubygems.org/gems/jsonapi-authorization)

`JSONAPI::Authorization` adds authorization to the [jsonapi-resources][jr] (JR) gem using [Pundit][pundit].

***PLEASE NOTE:*** This gem is still considered to be ***alpha quality***. Make sure to test for authorization in your application, too. We should have coverage of all operations, though. If that isn't the case, please [open an issue][issues].

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'jsonapi-authorization'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install jsonapi-authorization

## Usage

Make sure you have a Pundit policy specified for every backing model that your JR resources use. Then hook this gem up to your application like so:

```ruby
JSONAPI.configure do |config|
  config.default_processor_klass = JSONAPI::Authorization::AuthorizingOperationsProcessor
end
```

Make all your JR controllers specify the user in the `context` if you are using the default authorizer class (see [Configuration](#configuration) below):

```ruby
class BaseResourceController < ActionController::Base
  include JSONAPI::ActsAsResourceController

  private

  def context
    {user: current_user}
  end
end
```

Have your JR resources include the `JSONAPI::Authorization::PunditScopedResource` module.

```ruby
class BaseResource < JSONAPI::Resource
  include JSONAPI::Authorization::PunditScopedResource
  abstract
end
```

If you want to send a custom response for unauthorized requests, add a `rescue_from` hook to your `BaseResourceController` and whitelist `Pundit::NotAuthorizedError` in your JR configuration.

## Known bugs

There is a bug affecting `jsonapi-resources` error whitelisting, see https://github.com/cerebris/jsonapi-resources/pull/573. To make your whitelisting and `rescue_from` to work properly, here is a potential workaround:

```ruby
JSONAPI.configure do |config|
  config.exception_class_whitelist = [Pundit::NotAuthorizedError]
end
```

```ruby
class BaseResourceController < ActionController::Base
  rescue_from Pundit::NotAuthorizedError, with: :user_not_authorized

  private

  # https://github.com/cerebris/jsonapi-resources/pull/573
  def handle_exceptions(e)
    if JSONAPI.configuration.exception_class_whitelist.any? { |k| e.class.ancestors.include?(k) }
      raise e
    else
      super
    end
  end

  def user_not_authorized
    head :forbidden
  end
end
```

## Configuration

You can use a custom authorizer class by specifying a configure block in an initializer file. If using a custom authorizer class, be sure to require them at the top of the initializer before usage.

```ruby
JSONAPI::Authorization.configure do |config|
  config.authorizer = MyCustomAuthorizer
end
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bundle install` to install dependencies. Then, run `bundle exec rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
