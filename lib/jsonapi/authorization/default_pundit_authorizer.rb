  module Authorization
    # An authorizer is a class responsible for linking JSONAPI operations to
    # your choice of authorization mechanism.
    #
    # This class uses Pundit for authorization. It does not yet support all
    # the available operations — you can use your own authorizer class instead
    # if you have different needs. See the README.md for configuration
    # information.
    #
    # Fetching records is the concern of +PunditScopedResource+ which in turn
    # affects which records end up being passed here.
